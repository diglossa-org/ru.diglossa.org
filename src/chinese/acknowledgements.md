> my sincere thanks


Pener E. Hauer (linguasoft, Vienna), whose active participation and advice helped tremendously to adapt a software package for Oriental languages to the needs and expectations of real-life users

Boris Orekhov (HSE, Moscow), whose sharp disagreement with my views on the sad future of linguistics was very fruitful and mobilizing

Vitaly Lipatov, (http://EterSoft.ru, St.Petersburg) who created the package for BaseAlt Linux distribution Sisyphus: http://sisyphus.ru

and the entire team and leadership of http://basealt.ru, without whose long-term assistance project http://diglossa.org would be unthinkable and unimaginable
